This is a hardcoded two players snake game, but you can always change that in code; implementing more than two players is very straightforward. Code has some comments where you need to make changes; otherwise, if you want to understand the complete logic of the game, then you should check the file in the Single player version, which has lots of comments in it for understanding the code.
